# Cat-Dog-Classifier

A dataset with cats and dogs is taken from Kaggle.
An ImageDataGenerator from the keras module is used to process the images before training.
While `rescale` was used to normalise the images, other attributes were added to reduce overfitting of data.
A sequential model was trained to differentiate the images.
